  PIC32MZW Driver BSS Find Header File

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    wdrv_pic32mzw_bssfind.h

  Summary:
    PIC32MZW wireless driver BSS scanning header file.

  Description:
    This interface manages the operation of searching for a BSS.

    Searching operates on the find-first/find-next principal. When a find-first
      operation is requested the PIC32MZW will scan for available BSSs on the
      channels specified. The results will be provided via callback or polling
      and iterated over using a find-next operation.

    The callback function supplied to WDRV_PIC32MZW_BSSFindFirst may return true
      if the user wishes the next scan results to be automatically requested. By
      returning true the user can avoid needing to call WDRV_PIC32MZW_BSSFindNext,
      the callback will be called for each BSS found.

  Summary:
    Callback to signal discovery of a BSS.

  Description:
    When the information about a discovered BSS is requested the driver will

  Parameters:
    handle      - Client handle obtained by a call to WDRV_PIC32MZW_Open.
    index       - Index of BSS find results.
    ofTotal     - Total number of BSS find results.
    pBSSInfo    - Pointer to BSS information structure.

  Returns:
    If true is returned the PIC32MZW driver will automatically fetch the next BSS
    find results which will cause a later call to this callback. If false is
    returned the PIC32MZW driver will not fetch the next BSS find results, the user
    must call WDRV_PIC32MZW_BSSFindNext to retrieve them.

  Remarks:
    The callback function must return true or false. true indicates that the user
      wishes the next BSS information structure be provided. false indicates that
      the user will call WDRV_PIC32MZW_BSSFindNext to obtain the next BBS
      information structure.
